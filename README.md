# Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) Quadruple Extraction
This repo contains the data sets and source code of our paper: 

Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment Quadruple Extraction with Implicit Aspects and Opinions [[ACL 2021]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.29.pdf).
- We introduce a new ABSA task, named Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment Quadruple (ACOS) Extraction, to extract fine-grained ABSA Quadruples from product reviews;
- We construct two new datasets for the task, with ACOS quadruple annotations, and benchmark the task with four baseline systems;
- Our task and datasets provide a good support for discovering implicit opinion targets and implicit opinion expressions in product reviews.

## Task
The Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) Quadruple Extraction aims to extract all aspect-category-opinion-sentiment quadruples in a review sentence and provide full support for aspect-based sentiment analysis with implicit aspects and opinions.
